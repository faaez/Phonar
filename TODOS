So here are a bunch of todos I'm adding that are fresh in my mind right now. Add your own pet peeves.

General issues:
1. Remove hardcoded locations
2. Security of user's phone number and locations
3. Two-way phonaring: When you ask someone to bronar you to see their location, they should be able to see your location too.

UI issues:
1. Figure out why images are not showing on Nitin's phone
2. Display distance to a person under their icon. If we do this, maybe we don't need to change the image size as you move closer and further away, since it doesn't work for people who are really far away. This will also allow us to ensure that text below a person's face is always visible.
3. Prettify the text under a person's icon
4. If the person is not in the screen, put an arrow on the screen to point to where they should move the camera to see them,
5. Everywhere where it says "1234567890 wants to phonar you", display their name. If no name available, then only display number. We already have a function to convert number to name, so shouldn't be too hard
6. Map view should autozoom in to the location (depending on accuracy)
7. Display the path to people's locations in the map view.
8. Option to bronar someone through text rather than push. This could have 2 advantages: 1) usable in places with no wifi/3G 2) SMS is naturally more attention-grabbing than a push notification.
9. Maybe implemented face recognition in the future
10. Ignore push notifications if they are too old, no need sending location back if the user is seeing notification after a few hours of location being requested
11. Add Share location / Decline buttons into push notification, so the user does not have to do 2 clicks but 1


Server issues: 
1. Make it so it it auto refreshes auth token if it expires, rather than hard coding it into code.
2. Try http requests (to and from server) atleast 3 times before giving up.
